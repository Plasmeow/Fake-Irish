<h3>The Salmon of Knowledge - what there is to know</h3>   

<img class="center center-1" src="../Bilder/cropped-Big Fish.jpg" alt="Big Fish of Belfast">
<t2 class="center center-1"><t1>"The Big Fish" by John Kindnes, 1999, made as a celebration of fishes returning to river Lagan, Belfast</t2></t1>

<h1>A brief version of the story</h1>

<h2>Fionn MacCumhail, known for his many exploits in <t1>The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn</t1>,
     was a central figure during the Irish Fenian Cycle. One of the most famous 
     stories from <t1>The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn</t1> is <t1>The Salmon of Knowledge</t1>, which 
     we will be going through today.</h2>

     <br>   

<h2>Irish mythology depicts a hazel tree as the first thing to come into existence, 
    with its branches containing the knowledge of the entire universe. This very 
    hazel tree stretched over the Well of Wisdom, and in this well lived a fish, 
    an ordinary salmon. Whenever a hazelnut would fall into the well, the fish 
    would eat them and, in turn, gain the knowledge of the entire universe. 
    The prophecy goes that the first to catch and eat said salmon would gain its knowledge. </h2>

<h2>After 7 years of trying and failing, a man by the name of Finegas managed to 
    catch it. Finegas instructed his apprentice, Fionn, to prepare the fish for 
    him but to never have a taste of it. In the process of preparing it, he touched 
    the fish to check if it was done, and got burning fish fat all over his thumb. 
    This led to the boy putting his thumb in his mouth to soothe the pain. 
    Once he brought the fish back to Finegas, he noticed a new-found shine of 
    wisdom in the boy's eyes, proceeding to ask Fionn if he'd had a taste of its 
    flesh. Fionn responded no, and explained what happened. Finegan, realizing he had gained the salmon's knowledge, let him have the fish.</h2>    

    <br>   

<h2>From then on, Fionn would draw upon this knowledge by biting his thumb.</h2>
<br>  

<h1>My personal connection to it</h1>

<h2>I remember when grandmother told me about this story at the ripe age of 7.
    We would visit quite often back then. That dingy little appartment in the outskirts
    of the city was where I created most of my early memories.
Can't say my 7-year-old self remembers anything but "this guy became wise when he bit his thumb",
evidenced by the fact that I started biting my thumb when I was trying really hard
to concentrate on doing my homework. So much so that I have an extra visible line
on it from doing it too often. It's a bit embarassing, but I still find myself
biting my thumb in my very adult years.

<t2>Note: there are different versions of this story, but they all end the same way.</t2>
