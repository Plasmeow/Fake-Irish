<h1>Who is this idiot?</h1>    

<h2>Just a regular guy from Belfast with an agenda!</h2>

<h2>There is really nothing remarkable about me. I'd blend right in with the rest of Northern Irelanders.
    I'm average all around, you'd be amazed at how average I am. Averagely awesome, and awesomely average about
    making sure nobody knows more about me than they need to. This is why I'm being a dickead right now.
    The only "remarkable" thing about me would be that I'm currently working part-time as a waiter at a subpar family diner,
    while trying to get my master's degree.</h2>

<h2><t1><t3>"But, Fake Irish, how can you balance both that and the coding that comes with making your own blog? Do you really have time to be doing all this? How much sleep do you even get?"</t1></h2></t3>

<br>  


<h2>That's a great question! Don't ask it again.</h2>
