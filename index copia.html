<h1>What's with the name?</h1>

<h2>
    The purpose of this blog is to unite with but also poke fun at the concept of being "fake Irish".
    While this term may have a <a class="two" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeIrish" target="_blank"><t1>different definition</t1></a> in online spaces, my personal experience with it is completely separate.
    These words have been used against me by people of the Republic of Ireland to say I'm "not Irish enough" to call myself Irish, despite being from Northern Ireland.
    Which, you know, has the word Ireland in it, which... would make me Irish (please do not look further into this logic).
</h2>

<h2>
    Of course, we have our differences.
    We don't use the same currency, for one.
    Though, we are both <t1>very</t1> Christian, and I'm not sure who "those damn protestants" are anymore, was it you or me?

<h2>Despite the mere existence of the two Irelands, I will avoid (what I deem to be) political topics.</h2>
